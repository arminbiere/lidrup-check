- complete strict mode
- binary proof format
- linear proofs (LRUP) with chains
- having a terminating '.' line?
- printing hashes from 'icnf' file?
- how to communicate back checked queries?
- produce occasionally empty clauses in fuzzer
- blocking literal or at least binary only clauses
- add tests for full coverage of error messages
- complete strict and relaxed mode in checker
- add pedantic, strict and relaxed mode to fuzzer
- parser input fuzzing with fuzzsexpr and/or AFL
- sorting lines (Use radix sort? Separate 'sorted' line?)
- separate unit clause hash table for precise semantics
- completely reset trail after removing unit clause
- add 'idrup-play' to 'execute' interaction file and produce proof
- add mode which only takes the proof file and checks it
- add mode to check DIMACS files with DRUP/LRAT
- implement backward checking from current query
- consider to use ILB for checking
- generalize the two bit counter
